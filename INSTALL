INSTALLATION

Modify yacal.cgi so that the datafile is in a place writeable
by the user as whom the webserver runs.  Place yacal.cgi in a 
cgi-bin directory for your webserver.  Light fuse and get away.

You'll also want to install the perl modules Time::Piece,
Time::Piece::Month, Time::Seconds, XML::RSS, and Palm::Datebook
(part of p5-Palm).  For help on installing perl modules see
    <http://www.google.com/search?q=perlmodinstall>

Put your calendar in an area with Basic Authentication enabled
if you want a private calendar.  (See your webserver's documentation.)

Set up a cron job to periodically archive the datafile (e.g. with RCS)
and remove old events, e.g.

    2 1 * * * ci -l -m'' /path/to/datafile && /some/path/trim-old-yacal-events
