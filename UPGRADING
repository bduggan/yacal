As of version 0.04, 12:01 am means there's no
start or end time for an event.  Previously, start 
and end times defaulted to 0:00 and 23:00 respectively 
(and wouldn't be visible on the calendar).  To change 
all those times to be blank, just run 

    perl -i -p -e 's/ 0:00/ 0:01/g' /your/yacal-data-file
    perl -i -p -e 's/23:00/ 0:01/g' /your/yacal-data-file
