Yacal -- yet another calendar

Motivation
----------
yacal is intended to be concise and malleable, with few dependencies.

Things like authentication, recurring events, interfaces to a relational
database, and fancy graphics were deliberately not implemented.

The design goals were to have :
    - a clear presentation
    - the ability to edit a day while looking at the rest of the days
      (no clicking, editing, coming back)
    - highly maintainable, and easily auditable source code
    - no javascript or other server side languages
    - lightweight and fast (i.e. without needing a dedicated mod_perl webserver)
    - data stored in a highly portable, readable format (Data::Dumper)

Interface-wise, I wanted to mimick a paper month-based calendar as closely
as possible.
